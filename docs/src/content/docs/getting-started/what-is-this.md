## What is Preactor?


**Preactor** is a lightweight and efficient wrapper around Unity's UI Toolkit, designed to streamline the process of creating user interfaces within Unity.
By leveraging the power of **Preact**, a fast and minimal JavaScript library, and **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework,
Preactor allows you to develop responsive and highly customizable UIs using JavaScript.

With Preactor, you can build complex interfaces with less boilerplate and more flexibility, combining the familiarity of modern web development practices with the robust UI capabilities of Unity. This package is particularly beneficial for developers looking to maintain consistency in design while simplifying the UI development workflow.
