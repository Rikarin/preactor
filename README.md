## üöÄ Overview

**Preactor** is a revolutionary toolkit that bridges the gap between modern web development and Unity game development, empowering you to create stunning, responsive user interfaces with unprecedented ease and flexibility.

By bringing **Preact** (a fast 3kB alternative to React) and **Tailwind CSS** (a utility-first CSS framework) into the Unity ecosystem, Preactor transforms how you approach UI development in your games and applications.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß© Modern Component-Based Architecture
- Build reusable, modular UI components
- Implement reactive interfaces that update automatically when data changes
- Organize your UI code more logically and maintainably
- Leverage the familiar JSX-like syntax that web developers love

### üé® Effortless Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Access thousands of utility classes for instant styling
- Maintain consistent design language across your entire project
- Implement responsive designs that work across different screen sizes
- Customize your UI without writing a single line of CSS

### ‚ö° Streamlined Development Workflow
- Hot reloading capabilities for instant feedback
- TypeScript support for type safety and better tooling
- Efficient compilation through esbuild
- Seamless integration with Unity's existing systems

### üîÑ Unity Addressables Integration
- Load UI components asynchronously for better performance
- Update your UI without requiring a full app update
- Optimize memory usage by loading only what you need
- Implement dynamic content updates post-release

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing Preactor, ensure you have:

- Unity 6000.0 or newer
- Node.js 14+ and npm installed on your development machine
- Basic familiarity with Unity's Package Manager
- Git installed (for package installation)

## üîß Installation

### 1. Install Preactor via Unity's Package Manager

1. Open Unity.
2. Navigate to `Window > Package Manager`.
3. Click the **+** button in the top-left corner and select **Install package from Git URL...**.
4. Enter the following Git URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/Rikarin/preactor.git?path=/Assets/Plugins/Preactor
   ```

### 2. Initialize the Preactor Directory

After installation, initialize the Preactor directory:

```sh
mkdir Preactor
```

### 3. Copy Solution Files

Copy the contents of the `./Preactor/solution` directory from the Preactor Git repository into your `<Project>/Preactor` directory.

### 4. Compile JavaScript Views

Compile your JavaScript views with:

```sh
pnpm run start
```

### 5. Set Up Preactor in the Scene

1. Create a global object: `Preactor > Preactor Global`
2. Create a renderer object: `Preactor > Preactor Renderer`
3. Import your compiled JavaScript view into the renderer object

## üíª Usage Example

Here's a simple example of a button component in Preactor:

```tsx
import Button from './Button';

function SaveButton() {
  return (
    <Button 
      variant="default"
      color="green"
      onClick={() => saveData()}
    >
      Save
    </Button>
  );
}

// Different button variants
function ButtonVariants() {
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-4">
      <Button variant="default">Default</Button>
      <Button variant="small">Small</Button>
      <Button variant="icon">üîç</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üåü Benefits
